# 🚀 Sega Mega Drive Dodgeball — Planning & Progress

📍 **GitHub Repo:** [https://github.com/legendpaul/segagame](https://github.com/legendpaul/segagame)

## 🎯 Project Overview

- Theme: Realistic dodgeball, inspired by FIFA 94
- Platform: Sega Mega Drive (Genesis), PAL & NTSC
- Goal: ROM runs on real hardware & emulators
- Code style: Modular, <50 LOC per file, clear contracts
- AI Agents: ChatGPT, Claude, Jules
- Core Philosophy: **Test-Driven Design (TDD)** — all features are written with corresponding isolated tests before inclusion in the main game.
- Startup Modes: `TEST` and `PLAY`
  - `TEST` mode shows a Test Menu with all available tests grouped by feature (AI / Graphics / Sound Effect / Music / Animation / Screen Transition / Text / Joypad Input)
  - Tests are modular and easily added/removed in isolation

## 📈 Current Status

| Component             | Status         | Notes |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ----- |
| Game loop             | ✅ Done         | `src/main.c`, scene dispatcher |
| Scene: Menu           | ✅ Done         | `src/scene_menu.c` - team select |
| Scene: Match          | ✅ Done         | `src/scene_match.c` - full throw/catch/score loop |
| Scene: Gameover       | ✅ Done         | `src/scene_gameover.c` |
| Input manager         | ✅ Done         | `src/input_mgr.c` |
| Player entity         | ✅ Done         | `src/player.c` |
| Ball entity           | ✅ Done         | `src/ball.c` |
| Collision manager     | ✅ Done         | catch/hit resolution inline in `scene_match.c` |
| AI manager            | ✅ Done         | `src/ai_mgr.c` |
| Graphics assets       | ✅ Done         | hand-authored tiles in `src/sprites_data.c` (no external image pipeline) |
| Music & SFX           | ✅ Done (SFX)   | PSG sound effects in `src/sound_mgr.c`; no music track yet |
| Test Mode framework   | 🔲 Not started | deferred - shipped gameplay took priority; see Open Questions |

Builds clean with SGDK (`build.bat`) to a real, checksummed `out/rom.bin`. Verified live in
the Fusion emulator: boot (TMSS splash), menu + team select, full match (movement, throw,
catch, hits, scoring, round reset, game over) all confirmed working. Not yet tested on real
Mega Drive hardware.

## 📝 Design Decisions

- Global state centralized in `game_state.h`
- Scene-driven architecture (`scene_menu`, `scene_match`, `scene_gameover`)
- Separate managers: input, AI, collision, sound
- Separate entities: player, ball, team, referee
- Assets organized in `/gfx`, `/sfx`, `/tiles`
- All features are implemented in tandem with modular tests that can run independently in `TEST` mode
- Tests grouped into: AI / Graphics / Sound Effect / Music / Animation / Screen Transition / Text / Joypad Input

---

## 🔍 Open Questions

- How many teams & players per team?
- Power-ups or realistic-only?
- Tournament mode depth?
- Preferred structure for storing and selecting tests in `TEST` mode?

## 📂 File Conventions

| Folder      | Purpose                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| `/src`      | All code files               |
| `/assets`   | Art & sound                 |
| `/docs`     | Planning, design            |
| `/build`    | Compiled ROMs               |
| `/tests`    | Isolated test modules       |

## 🪄 Next Steps

✅ Agents can now pick any task ID(s) above and begin implementation, ensuring progress is reflected here. When implementing any feature, create and register its test case(s) under `/tests` and hook it into the `TEST` menu.

🎮 *Let’s build a great Mega Drive game — together — and test it thoroughly every step of the way!*
